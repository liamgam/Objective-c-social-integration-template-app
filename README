<h1>This is a template for iPhone developers.</h1>
<h3>Android, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile 7 soon to come</h3>
<p>This template application can be used to get you up and running on facebook, twitter, and gowalla in less than a minute. All you have to do is change the variables for the api key, app key etc.. to match your credentials.
Once you put in your credentials then you can build and test.</p>
<p>There are two buttons on the home page after you sign in. The first button gets the users data and displays that data in the log using NSLog(); The second button pops up a dialog to post to facebook and displays the template actions links. </a>
<p>Feel free to use this in anyway you like. Comments and help is always appreciated.</p>
